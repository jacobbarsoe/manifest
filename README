see instructions on oe-lite.org on how to get requirements for oe-lite.

Next, clone this repository:

oe clone https://github.com/jacobbarsoe/raspberry.git

add a local.conf in your raspberry/conf dir similar to below.
you can change PARALLEL_MAKE and SDK_CPU to fit your needs.


Then you are ready to get a bootable SD-card:

cd raspberry
oe bake bootfs rootfs 
#(wait a while)
#assuming sd-card reader is /dev/sdb (be sure script does not double check
#if you got it wrong and disk will be erased!
./meta/raspberrypi/scripts/mk_sd.sh /dev/sdb /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2 tmp/images


LOCAL.conf:
DISTRO		= "raspberrypi"
MACHINE = "rpi"
PROVIDED	 = "all"
SDK_CPU		 = "i686"
SDK_OS		 = "linux-gnu"
RMWORK		 = "0"
PREBAKE_PATH	 = "${TOPDIR}/prebake"
PARALLEL_MAKE	 = "-j 4"
