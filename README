see instructions on oe-lite.org on how to get requirements for oe-lite.

Next, clone this repository:

oe clone https://github.com/jacobbarsoe/raspberry.git

add a local.conf in your raspberry/conf dir e.g. by copying local.conf.sample
you can change PARALLEL_MAKE and SDK_CPU to fit your needs.


Then you are ready to get a bootable SD-card:

cd raspberry
oe bake bootfs rootfs 
#(wait a while)
#assuming sd-card reader is /dev/sdb (be sure script does not double check
#if you got it wrong and disk will be erased!
./meta/raspberrypi/scripts/mk_sd.sh /dev/sdb /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2 tmp/images


TODO:
a recipe to setup config.txt to configure overclocking, hdmi, etc.
(I however just uses the serial console so I have not been in need for this yet)
