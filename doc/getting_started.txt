Getting Started
---------------
see instructions on the OE-lite handbook on http://oe-lite.org/doc/handbook/handbook.html#_requirements[oe-lite.org] on how to get requirements for oe-lite.

Next, clone this repository:

-----
oe clone git://oe-lite.org/bsp/raspberrypi.git
-----

add a +local.conf+ in your +raspberry/conf+ dir e.g. by copying +local.conf.sample+
you can change +PARALLEL_MAKE+ and +SDK_CPU+	 to fit your needs.


Building
~~~~~~~~

-----
# cd raspberry
# oe bake machine -y
-----

\... wait a while ...


Create an SD card
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Then you are ready to get a bootable SD-card:
Assuming sd-card reader is /dev/mmcblik0 (be sure script does not double check!
IF you got it wrong and disk will be erased!:

-----
# ./scripts/mk_sd.sh /dev/mmcblk0 tmp/images
-----

Configuring to fit your needs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

rootfs:: This recipe holds the packages that you want in your filesystem. This example provides you with a minimal system that are able to boot very fast but not much else.

bootfs:: You should not have to changes this recipe. However it provides the needed files for booting.

Config.txt :: A recipe in +meta/bcm2835+ provides "bcm-config" to setup +config.txt+ to configure overclocking, hdmi, etc. (This manifest however just uses the serial console so it has not been implemented yet). 
To override this config add a new recipe that provides "bcm-config" but with a higher +DEFAULT_PREFERENCE+ then your manifest will override any settings in the original +config.txt+. 

linux:: We default to use the official Raspberry Pi linux 3.2.27 branch. However recipes 
for using the other official branches are provided.
This can be changed by setting the +DEFAULT_PREFERENCE+ variable in the chosen linux recipe (e.g. +recipes/linux/rpi-linux_3.10.y+) or by adding this line to the distro configuration,
+conf/distro/raspberrypi.conf+:

-----
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_linux = "rpi-3.10.y" 
-----


Migrating the project to your own bare git repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To use this feature please refer to the requirements in the OE-lite http://oe-lite.org/doc/handbook/handbook.html#_from_template[handbook].

-----
oe clone --bare raspberrypi raspberrypi.git
-----
Now you can move your .git folder anywhere you like and your are hosting your own raspberry pi project!


Known isuses
------------
Rebooting the Pi a lot can make you SD card fail. This is due to the underlying SD card wear leveling. To circumvent this you need to make your filesystem read only.
